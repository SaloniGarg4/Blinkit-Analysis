# 🛒 Blinkit Sales Analysis (Python Project)

## 📊 Project Overview
The **Blinkit Sales Analysis** project is a **Python-based data analysis project** designed to uncover key business insights for **Blinkit**, an online grocery delivery platform.  

Using real-world–style sales data, this project analyzes sales trends, outlet performance, and item-level behavior through data cleaning, EDA, and visualization. It demonstrates end-to-end **data analysis using Python** — from raw data to actionable insights.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze Blinkit’s sales data to identify:
- What factors influence **sales performance**?  
- Do sales depend more on **outlet size** or **location type**?  
- Which **item categories** contribute most to total sales?  
- How does the **establishment year** affect total sales across outlets?  

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset `blinkit_data.csv` contains information about:
- **Item Type, Item Fat Content, Item Visibility**  
- **Outlet Size, Location Type, Establishment Year**  
- **Sales Amount, Outlet Identifier**, and other related features  

This data enables exploration of how product attributes and outlet characteristics impact sales performance.

---

## 📌 Key Insights & Findings
- 🏬 **Tier 3 outlets** recorded the **highest total sales**, indicating untapped market strength.  
- 🏗️ **Outlet size** influences sales more strongly than location type.  
- 🍎 **Fruits and Vegetables** category contributes the most to revenue.  
- 📈 Outlets established after **2010** show a consistent upward trend in sales performance.  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation   
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization and charting  

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Treated missing values and inconsistencies  
   - Standardized categorical values  
   - Removed duplicates  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed sales distribution by outlet size and location  
   - Studied the relationship between item type and sales  
   - Evaluated the effect of establishment year on sales  

3. **Visualization**
   - Created bar, line, and pie charts for clearer insights  
   - Used visual patterns to identify high- and low-performing outlets  

---

## 📈 Key Visuals
- **Bar Charts:** Outlet Size vs. Sales, Item Type vs. Sales  
- **Line Chart:** Sales trend by Establishment Year  
- **Pie Chart:** Sales distribution by Location Type
